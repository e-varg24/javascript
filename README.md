# javascript

## Description 

	This weeks challenge was about making a password generator using all type of different characters and making it random based on the users input. We had to use javascript to input all these different buttons and call for the variables.

 ## usage

    To use this website you first enter the number of characters you would like to input and then upper/ lower case letters, numbers and special characters. Once all that is inputted you get your random generated password. 

## What i learned

    I learned a lot from this lesson! Starting off by learning how to make the arrays of numbers and letters. Once the arrays were made, I could use them to be put into the password generator. I learned how to make the buttons and call for them with the clickers. All this was super useful and helpful to understand javascript more
